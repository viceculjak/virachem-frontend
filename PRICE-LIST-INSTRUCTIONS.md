## ⚠️ Important: Pricing Tiers Update

### **Both Website AND Price List:**
- Show only **5 pricing tiers** (1-500 units)
- Tier 5 max: **201-500 units** (BEST Value)
- Quantities **> 500 units** redirect to **Model 2: Custom Manufacturing**
- Message shown: _"📦 Need quantities over 500 vials? For bulk orders, please use Model 2"_

**Rationale:** We emphasize Model 2 (Custom Manufacturing) as our core offering for bulk orders. The 6th tier (501-999 units) has been removed from both the public website and internal price list to maintain consistency and focus on Model 2 for high-volume programs.

## How to Update Prices

The HTML file currently contains **sample pricing** based on the standard tier structure. To update with actual prices:

### Pricing Formula (from your database `pricing_tiers_config`):

```
Price per unit = cost_per_vial / margin

Margins by tier:
- Tier 1 (1-5 units):     margin = 0.25 (75%)  →  Price = cost / 0.25 = cost × 4.00
- Tier 2 (6-20 units):    margin = 0.35 (65%)  →  Price = cost / 0.35 = cost × 2.86
- Tier 3 (21-50 units):   margin = 0.45 (55%)  →  Price = cost / 0.45 = cost × 2.22
- Tier 4 (51-200 units):  margin = 0.53 (47%)  →  Price = cost / 0.53 = cost × 1.89
- Tier 5 (201-500 units): margin = 0.58 (42%)  →  Price = cost / 0.58 = cost × 1.72  ← BEST Value
```

**Note:** Quantities over 500 units redirect to Model 2 for personalized quotes

### Example Calculation:

For **Retatrutide 5mg** with `cost_per_vial = €8.50`:
- Tier 1: €8.50 / 0.25 = **€34.00/unit** (baseline)
- Tier 2: €8.50 / 0.35 = **€24.29/unit** (29% off)
- Tier 3: €8.50 / 0.45 = **€18.89/unit** (44% off)
- Tier 4: €8.50 / 0.53 = **€16.04/unit** (53% off)
- Tier 5: €8.50 / 0.58 = **€14.66/unit** (57% off) ← **BEST Value - stops here**

1. Get actual `cost_per_vial` values from your database
2. Use the formula above to calculate all 6 tier prices
3. Update the pricing tables in the HTML
4. Update product details (CAS, MW, etc.) from database
